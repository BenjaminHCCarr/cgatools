Adapted based on http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/ on Jan 21, 2010. In
md5.c at that URL, it says:

"This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.  The
algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was written by Colin Plumb
in 1993, no copyright is claimed.  This code is in the public domain;
do with it what you wish."

"Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.  This code
has been tested against that, and is equivalent, except that you
don't need to include two pages of legalese with every copy."
